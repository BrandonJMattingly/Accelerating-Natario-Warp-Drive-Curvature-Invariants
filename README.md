# Accelerating-Natario-Warp-Drive-Curvature-Invariants ver 1.0 on 11/17/20

Notebook(s) Description:
____________________
These notebooks calculate the curvature invariants for the accelerating Natario warp drive. 
They take a spacetime metric and a null tetrad as inputs and output the curvature invariant functions. Then, they may plot the functions as desired.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES:
____________________
- Run individual notebooks on Wolfram Mathematica.
- Be sure to run the Clear[...] line before running.
- You may ignore the "Do you want to automatically evaaluate all the inialization cells..." line if prompted.
- Run in order from top to bottom starting with the "Defining ..." cell block and ending on the "Finding the Weyl Tensor" cell block.
- Due to time constraints, I would recommend skipping the "Finding the Invariants" cell block and only running the "Finding the NP Invariants..." cell block. They both calculate the same quantities.
- The "Plotting the NP Invariants" cell may be run to display the invariant in the title of each notebook. It may be modified with its first cell, and it contains a variety of choices for the free parameters.
- The "Plots for the Paper" cell block contains a selection of plots used in the paper "Curvature Invariants for the Accelerating Natario Warp Drive" in Particles 3.
